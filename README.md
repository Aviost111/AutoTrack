# AutoTrack

AutoTrack is an application designed to streamline the monitoring of treatments and refueling for heavy-duty vehicles in companies. Unlike private vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles require treatments after a certain number of engine hours rather than kilometers driven. AutoTrack aims to replace traditional paper-based logging systems used by employees to record vehicle usage, offering a digital solution for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.

## Features

### 1. Treatment Monitoring
- Track treatments required for heavy-duty vehicles based on engine hours.
- Receive notifications or alerts when vehicles are due for treatment.

### 2. Refueling Management
- Record refueling activities for vehicles.
- Keep track of fuel consumption and expenses.

### 3. Employee Monitoring
- Allow managers to monitor employee activities related to vehicle usage.
- View which employee treated, refueled, or drove which vehicle.

### 4. Vehicle History
- Provide access to comprehensive vehicle history for employees and managers.
- View past treatments, refueling activities, and driving records for each vehicle.
